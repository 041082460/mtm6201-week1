                    <p>Hello there dear reader! My name is Juan Sierra, I come from Colombia and I am currently studying IMD(Interactive Media Design). My Student Number is 041082460, and this is the Github Pages repository for Web Development class in the first week of semester number two.<br><br>
                    I was born in the musical capital of Colombia, I was born in Ibague, Tolima. Since very little I was fascinated by the things my region would do every year, things such as carnivals, festivals, and special events, moreover, they were all filled to the top with the essence of what it is to be a colombian.
                        </p>
